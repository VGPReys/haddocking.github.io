We are organising a HADDOCK integrative modelling workshop at Academia Sinica in Taipei as a satellite event of the [International Symposium on Grid and Cloud computing](https://indico4.twgrid.org/event/25/). The workshop will take place on March 20th. Registration information can be found at the [ISGC2023 website](https://indico4.twgrid.org/event/25/page/46-registration).


This workshop (detailed programme [here](https://indico4.twgrid.org/event/25/images/74-Workshop%20on%20Integrative%20modelling%20with%20HADDOCK_Final.jpg)) will consist of lectures and computer tutorials during which some of the recent HADDOCK developments will be discussed and demonstrated in hands-on computer tutorials. In particular we will introduce [HADDOCK3](https://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock3/), the new modular version of HADDOCK which represents a redesign of the HADDOCK2.X series, implementing new ways to interact with the HADDOCK sub-routines and offering more customization to the end user.

For the computer practical, participants are expected to bring their own laptop and register in advance to the [event](https://nmrbox.nmrhub.org/events/events/2023-haddock-isgc-taipei) we created on [NMRBOX](https://nmrbox.nmrhub.org) as we will be making use of those cloud resources for the HADDOCK3 workshop. Participants are encouraged to bring their own problems to get advice on the best modelling strategy.
